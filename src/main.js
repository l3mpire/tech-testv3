/*
Important notes

1) this Meteor project includes 2 special packages
- insecure: allows the client to write data (meaning that you don't need Meteor methods to write data to the database)
- autopublish: allows the client to access all server data without need of a publication/subscription

2) you only need to look at main.js and main.html files to understand the code.

3) your goal: suggest and implement a game or interactive feature using this base. 
   During the interview, we will review your implementation and may ask you to extend or modify it.
